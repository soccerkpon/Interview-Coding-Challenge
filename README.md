# TestDrivenApplication
This application was built using Test Driven techniques using .NET Core 7!

It consists of one controller with a swagger endpoint to calculate interest for 1 person that has up to 3 different credit cards. There are 4 scenarios defined in the unit tests that provide good examples for testing the controller. The controller calls the interface wich in turn calls the service to calculate the simple interest.

Inside of the controller there are three coding challenges defined. One for beginners, one for intermediate, and one advanced. This is designed to be used for interviews.
