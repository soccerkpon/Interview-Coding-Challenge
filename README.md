# TestDrivenApplication
This is a test driven application to calculate simple interest

It consists of one controller with a swagger endpoint to calculate interest for 1 or more people each having 3 different credit cards. There are three scenarios defined in the unit tests that provide good examples for testing the controller. The controller calls the interface wich in turn calls the service to calculate the simple interest.
